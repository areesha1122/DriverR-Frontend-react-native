# DriverR Frontend (React Native)

The DriverR Frontend is a mobile app developed using React Native, offering an intuitive interface for drivers to interact with the DriverR system. It enables drivers to control their profiles, view and apply for jobs, go through verification, and receive interview feedback. The app interfaces with the backend server for data retrieval and request submission, ensuring smooth integration with the DriverR ecosystem.

## Getting Started

### Setup Requirements

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Expo CLI (for development and testing)

### Installation Process

1. Repository Cloning:

   ````shell
   git clone https://github.com/areesha1122/DriverR-Frontend-react-native.git
   ```

   ````

2. Dependency Installation:

   ````shell
   cd driverR-frontend
   npm install
   ```

   ````

3. Environment Configuration:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

   ````plaintext
   API_BASE_URL=your-backend-api-url
   ```

   Replace `your-backend-api-url` with the URL of your DriverR backend API.

   ````

4. Application Launch:

   ````shell
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the Expo development server and provide options to run the app on a physical device or an emulator.
   ````

### Operational Use

Once the frontend is running on a mobile device or emulator, drivers can use the DriverR app to register, log in, manage their profiles, view job listings, apply for jobs, and undergo verification processes. The app will communicate with the backend server to fetch data and send requests as needed.

You can customize the frontend implementation according to your specific requirements and design preferences. Modify the screens, components, and logic to align with your application's needs. Ensure that the API calls and data handling comply with the backend API specifications.
